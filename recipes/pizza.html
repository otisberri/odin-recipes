    <h2>How to prepare pizza</h2>
    <p>Below is a list of the ingredients needed to prepare pizza and the steps to prepare it. It takes an average time of about 1hr to prepare this meal.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>2 Â½ cups bread flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Step 1</li>
        <p>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly grease a pizza pan.</p>

        <li>Step 2</li>
        <p>Place warm water in a bowl; add yeast and sugar. Mix and let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</p>

        <li>Step 3</li>
        <p>Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. You can do this by hand or use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook to make it easier. Let rest for 5 minutes.</p>

        <li>Step 4</li>
        <p>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a 12-inch circle. Transfer to the prepared pizza pan.</p>

        <li>Step 5</li>
        <p>Spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice.</p>

        <li>Step 3</li>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.</p>
    </ul>
